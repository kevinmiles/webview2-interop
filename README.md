# webview2-interop
Interop and C# wrapper classes for Microsoft WebView2 web browser control

When Microsoft revealed their plans for a Chrome based Edge browser the first thing I thought was "I wonder if they are going to support an embedded web browser control"?  Well sure enough they released [WebView2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/hosting/webview2) and I've been keeping an eye on the releases.  Recently I found a great [sample](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Browser) written by [David Risney](https://github.com/david-risney) and I was inspired to take a shot at putting together a C# version. 

This project contains interop code for the WebView2.  Most of it has been modified from what you get from the standard tlbimp command.  Besides the interop classes which match the [WebView2 interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/hosting/webview2/reference-webview2) closely there are also some wrapper classes around the interfaces available.  The wrappers try to take some of the patterns used in C++ and hopefully make them a little more C# friendly.   For example the add/remove methods with interface callbacks have been changed to Register/Unregister that take Actions with event arguments.  

The browser demo project can be downloaded from [webview2-dotnetbrowser](https://github.com/michael-russin/webview2-dotnetbrowser) 

Besides using this project it uses a [WebView2 Windows Forms control](https://github.com/michael-russin/webview2-control) implementation of WebView2 you can use in the Visual Studio designer. 

## Installing / Getting started

* Microsoft Edge (Chromium) installed on a supported OS.
* Visual Stdio 2017 or 2019 with C# and desktop development set up

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.
